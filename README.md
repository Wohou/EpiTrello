# EpiTrello – Epitech Professional Project

## Overview

This project is part of our fifth-year professional project at Epitech.
The main goal is to recreate the core functionalities of Trello while adding our own personality, design, and unique features.

The project serves as both a technical challenge and a professional experience, demonstrating best practices in software development, documentation, CI/CD, and containerization.
